### what the book is about

Hidden potential explores the science of achieving greater things. In particular, what forces drive someone to achieve things? One’s character, structure for motivation and systems for opportunity all seem to play a critical role in one’s achievements. Adam Grant studies these areas 

### what I liked about the book

An idea that struck me at the beginning part of the book is the idea of embracing discomfort for growth. I’m sure we’ve all heard of this idea before, that we can only get better when we put ourselves outside of our comfort zone. 

‘Becoming a creature of discomfort can unlock hidden potential in many different types of learning. Summoning the nerve to face discomfort is a character skill — an especially important form of determination. It takes three kinds of courage: to abandon your tried-and-true methods, to put yourself in the ring before you feel ready, and to make more mistakes than others make attempts. The best way to accelerate growth is to embrace, seek, and amplify discomfort’. 

I resonate with the idea of ‘doing’ things before you feel ready. If you wait until you are fully comfortable with something, opportunities will pass you by, Opportunities for rapid growth, guiding points, advice and much more can be missed. The same applies to teaching, we often think to teach something we need to be experts on the matter. In reality, sometimes teaching something is the best way to learn it.

When I took my AWS Solutions Architect Exam I didn’t want to take my test until I felt fully ‘ready’. But the issue was that I was spending more time overpreparing, I knew enough already to take the exam, but the anxiety of ‘what if I don’t know enough and I fail’ was holding me back from taking it. Once I let that go and figured that the worst-case scenario was I failed the exam, knew what I needed to study for next time and take it again in a month or two. This ultimately was the best decision for me as I was able to pass the exam without much difficulty as I prepared a lot. I had to be willing to miss (to fail) to hit my target (pass).
### why others should consider reading the book

I would recommend this book if you’re feeling stagnant, or looking for ideas on how to spark making learning fun again.
