### What makes people have 'high po tential'?

Hidden Potential by Adam Grant explores the science of what makes someone an effective achiever.
 What is it that enabled them to be the way they are, is it having a strong character? 
 Being a disciplined, super serious, no funny business type of person. Or is it the way they approach problems, 
 finding the right mentors, the right methods of learning, turning the daily grind into a source of daily joy. 
 Maybe high achievement is pre-defined based on the parameters given to the individual, if someone was born in 
 a first-world country going to the best schools and having private tutors, you would probably think they would
  achieve greater things than someone who grew up in a third-world country without access to any of that stuff.

# The Characteristics of someone who has high potential

## They behave like a sponge

        “Being a sponge is more than a metaphor. It’s a character skill — a form of proactivity that’s vital to realizing hidden potential. Improving depends not on the quantity of information you seek out, but the quality of the information you take in. Growth is less about how hard you work than how well you learn.”

To achieve rapid growth, you need to absorb information like a sponge. For example, when I’m learning a new programming language or technology my aim is to get exposed to as much as possible. I like to create notes, read case studies, and study diagrams to build a large mental model and have the resources to refer back to whenever I need them. 

In addition to absorbing information like a sponge, I think we also need to be proactive in the way we apply that knowledge. If we don’t learn from our mistakes we will make little to no progress. We have to get comfortable with not knowing everything, in other words, we have to get comfortable being uncomfortable to grow.

## They are creatures of discomfort.

        "Becoming a creature of discomfort can unlock hidden potential in many different types of learning. Summoning the nerve to face discomfort is a character skill — an especially important form of determination. It takes three kinds of courage: to abandon your tried-and-true methods, to put yourself in the ring before you feel ready, and to make more mistakes than others make attempts. The best way to accelerate growth is to embrace, seek, and amplify discomfort."

No one is ever an expert at first, they all started from somewhere. Learning takes time and skill, along the way there will be uncertainty. The possibility of making a mistake and making a fool of yourself can hold you back. Being able to put yourself out there without that fear allows you to focus on what serves you, and what doesn’t. It enables quick feedback loops allowing faster improvement as you allow for criticism to drive your development further rather than tear it down. 

I resonate with the idea of ‘doing’ things before you feel ready. If you wait until you are fully comfortable with something, opportunities will pass you by, Opportunities for rapid growth, guiding points, advice and much more can be missed. The same applies to teaching, we often think to teach something we need to be experts on the matter. In reality, sometimes teaching something is the best way to learn it.

When I took my AWS Solutions Architect Exam I didn’t want to take my test until I felt fully ‘ready’. But the issue was that I was spending more time overpreparing, I knew enough already to take the exam, but the anxiety of ‘what if I don’t know enough and I fail’ was holding me back from taking it. Once I let that go and figured that the worst-case scenario was I failed the exam, knew what I needed to study for next time and take it again in a month or two. This ultimately was the best decision for me as I was able to pass the exam without much difficulty as I prepared a lot. I had to be willing to miss (to fail) to hit my target (pass).



## They seek the right mentorship

Nothing accelerates learning and growth faster than a good mentor or coach. The right coach who is knowledgeable knows our current capabilities and is credible sounds like the best-case scenario, but it’s a bit more complicated than that. 

I think finding the right mentor will always depend on the task at hand. You don’t want someone who’s too far off from your experience because they can’t relate to you. 

No one’s experiences will be the same, so a mentor cannot step by step tell you everything you need to know, but it will help in your journey. 

It’s always good to frame it as such. Instead of asking for advice, ask for actional feedback. Instead of “what did you like about it” say “What can I do to improve for next time”. While listening to them, really listen in for the key turning points in the story as that will help you in navigating your way.
## what I liked about the book

It refutes the idea that we have a ‘preferred learning’ style. We were all fed this idea when we were younger but it turns out this isn’t true. Depending on the task, you could be a visionary learner, auditory, reader, etc… A learning style is not a one-size-fits-all solution.

### why others should consider reading the book

I would recommend this book if you’re feeling stagnant, or looking for ideas on how to spark making learning fun again.
