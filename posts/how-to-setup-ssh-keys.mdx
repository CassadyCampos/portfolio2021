### what are SSH keys and why use them
If you've ever worked on code collabratively, you've probably used some form of version control (I hope). Github, Gitlab, Azure DevOps, BitBucket etc... 
There are many choices out there. I will mostly be refering to Github in this article.
Everytime you interact with Github or some remote repository using Git, you are using some type of protocol for client-server communication.

Currently, Git supports the following
* HTTP
* HTTPS
* SSH
* Plain git

Arguably the most cryptographically secure network protocols in this list are HTTPS and SSH. 

Specifiacally with SSH, we are able to identify each user that is interacting with this git remote repository. Also, 
it allows contributors to bypass entering their credientials everytime they are interacting with the remote server.

### what is SSH
SSH stands for Secure Shell Protcol. 

Typically there are two keys. A public and private key. The public key is typically found stored on the computer of the user trying to log in remotely.
