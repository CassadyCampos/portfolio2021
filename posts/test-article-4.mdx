<div>
  This is a blog post about my journey of how I got into technology and coding, and how the experiences
  along the way shaped me into the technical proffessional I carry myself as today.
</div>

<br/>

### The beginning
The early parts of my life was spent like most other teenage boys. I loved playing video games, like, REALLY loved video games.
From creating personal websites, marking up HTML components on online avatar social sites like Gaia.com or creating a privitized 
VPN network on Hamachi to play Minecraft with my friends. Technology was all around me, I never took a deep dive into coding until University.

### My University experience
Three years after highschool, after a brief stint of working as a Barista for a local Calgary Coffee Shop: Good Earth Cafe, I decided to return to school 
to take Computer Science. Although this may seem like an no-brainer to someone who enjoyed technology so much, it was actually a very difficult decision. I would be committing
to a 4 year degree in a completely different city almost completely reliant on government student loans. However, I can confidently say that this decision is probably 
the best choice I have ever made with regards to my personal growth and career. 

### Where I am currently
I am currently working as a Full Stack Software Developer for a Calgary based Software Solutions Company called Arcurve Inc. I have worked with them throughout
my University career as a Student Software Developer. I am extremely grateful for the opportunities they have provided me as it has pushed me to become a great software engineer that
values hard work, working as a team, empowering others, and most importantly creating high quality software.
