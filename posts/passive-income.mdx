### introduction
passive income -- the subtle art of earnings derived in which a person is not actively involved.
that's just a fancy word of someone who generated income without really doing anything. now, they might have 
spent hours researching dividend stocks to receive quarterly payouts, or they might've purchased rental properties and are generating 
rental income. the key factor is that money is being earned regularly with little or no effect on the part of the person
receiving it.

At the moment, I'm really into using my current full-time income and figuring out ways I can use that to start generating passive income.
Currently, the best thing working for me is purchasing dividends. Very simply, I'd say it's pretty much investing into a business and receiving
scheduled payouts, ideally you could take your investments out whenever you want to.

### reflection
I am a programmer, I like to automate things, and the more I can automate incoming coming through, the better. Dividend income has such a high appeal for me.
If you look at your local bank provider, take a clooser look at the interest rate you're getting. The largest banks in Canada pretty much have an oligarchy, like many of
the other sectors in Canada (cell phones, internet services, cable). Most customers with these bank giants make as little as 0.01% interest as their 'high interest savings account'.

A couple summers ago I realized this scam, and did my research into different banks in Canada. It was usually the smaller, no physical card offering banks that offered atleast a 1.5%+ interest rate. 
When I discovered EQ bank they had an amazing 2.5% interest rate! Not only that but it was CDIC insuranced. Meaning that it was federally regulated within Canada, and was insured up to $100, 000. Perfect because
I'm no where near that bracket yet. 

and there we have it. just like that by moving my entire savings account off my terible 0.01% interest rate account I moved it into a high-interest savings account at EQ generating my about
$15 a month just for storing my money there. no gimmicks. i still help my TD account because I still had my VISA, and my debit card which I guess I still needed for physical transactions. But nevertheless
I was getting paid.

### when i moved into an apartment
i think anyone who's moved knows how expensive relocating can be. i had this experience since the age of 17 when i agreed to take out $15,000 a year
in government student loans. heh. anyways, fast forward maybe 4-5 years I'm looking to move into my first apartment with my girlfriend.
At this point I already had my EQ bank trick generating me some nice pocket change at the end of every month. and I wondered, can I leverage some of the purchases
of my apartment into another EQ savings account? Mind you, at the time of righting this, EQ has decreased their interests rates numerous times. It's sitting at about 1.25% right now which is still better
than most banks in Canada. 

most large purchases such as furniture, matresses, tv's and sometimes even amazon products let you finance your purchase at 0% interest rate. this basically means you make an agreement to
do scheduled payments (monthly, bi-weekly, etc...) to pay off the entire price tag. Now, I could have just bought out everything flat out, and be out thousands of dollars but I'm smarter than that.

straight out of highschool i worked as a barista at a local coffee shop in downtown Calgary. at this point i wasn't even programming, i was just a young kid trying to make some money. i remember i wanted to buy a nice car so freaking bad. 
i wanted it so bad, i worked at that coffee shop full-time for about a year and a half, and part time for another half year saving maybe 75-85% of my paycheque on average.
after those two or so years i went and purchased a 2008 Acura CSV for $7600. i distinctly remember going to the local bank, asking to withdraw basically all the money in my bank account in cash, haha i felt like a boss. how naive was i back then. 
anyways the moral of that story is that i learned to never empty out your bank account on large purchases. So here's what i did.

    1. one year before we even moved, i created a saving plan that we would save $200 each per month prior to moving
        i.e: in the end we saved about $8000
    2. when it came down to purchase our things, we most likely had the money to buy it out outright
        i.e: we wanted to purchase a $3000 TV, 2021 LG OLED C1
    3. when purchasing we created 0% interest financing plans
        i.e for the tv we did 12 months, $250/per month with an inital payment at the start
    4. we placed the $3000 in a shared EQ HISA, gaining interest monthly
    
    Result: We made nearly $60 from purchasing a TV we were going to purchase anyways!
