### introduction
passive income -- the subtle art of earnings derived in which a person is not actively involved.
that's just a fancy word of someone who generated income without really doing anything. now, they might have 
spent hours researching dividend stocks to receive quarterly payouts, or they might've purchased rental properties and are generating 
rental income. the key factor is that money is being earned regularly with little or no effect on the part of the person
receiving it.
