### Introduction
I think I have a pretty good break down of my current expenses.
Growing up, I don't think real financial literacy was ever taught to me. However, the struggles of
not having money were. I think my parents maybe just didn't know how to allocate their money probably when they were 
younger, fit to work, and working all the time. I prefer to do more of a hands off savings strategy that follows
common strategies you would see today. Currently, my monthly investments to my TFSA are made to Wealthsimple Trade. 
Additoinally I have a very small portion of my TFSA allocated to their robo advisor in their other app.
Less fequently, I also make contributions into various crypto and crypto exchanges. I record my monthly expenses in
a budgeting service called Mint, and have bank accounts set up with TD and EQ bank. 

I have been investing since the first lockdown of the Covid-19 pandemic. In Alberta, that lockdown started about
March 12th, 2020. So just about 2 years now. Since then, I have learned a ton about financial literacy. About saving for retirement,
compound interest, dollar-cost averaging, ETF's, TFSA's, RRSP's etc..!

Honestly looking back I can't exactly what got me into investing, the only regret I have is that I didn't start sooner. To anyone who doesn't know already
time is your best ally when it comes to investing. This is supported by the principal that the longer your have your money in the market, the longer it has time to grow
and compound. When I started investing the market was experience a strong correction following the Covid-19 lockdowns, it looked like a great opportunity to join the market.
