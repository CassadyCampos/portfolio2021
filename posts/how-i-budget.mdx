### Introduction
I think I have a pretty good break down of my current expenses.
Growing up, I don't think real financial literacy was ever taught to me. However, the struggles of
not having money were. I think my parents maybe just didn't know how to allocate their money probably when they were 
younger, fit to work, and working all the time. I prefer to do more of a hands off savings strategy that follows
common strategies you would see today. Currently, my monthly investments to my TFSA are made to Wealthsimple Trade. 
Additoinally I have a very small portion of my TFSA allocated to their robo advisor in their other app.
Less fequently, I also make contributions into various crypto and crypto exchanges. I record my monthly expenses in
a budgeting service called Mint, and have bank accounts set up with TD and EQ bank. 

I have been investing since the first lockdown of the Covid-19 pandemic. In Alberta, that lockdown started about
March 12th, 2020. So just about 2 years now. Since then, I have learned a ton about financial literacy. About saving for retirement,
compound interest, dollar-cost averaging, ETF's, TFSA's, RRSP's etc..!

Honestly looking back I can't exactly what got me into investing, the only regret I have is that I didn't start sooner. To anyone who doesn't know already
time is your best ally when it comes to investing. This is supported by the principal that the longer your have your money in the market, the longer it has time to grow
and compound. When I started investing the market was experience a strong correction following the Covid-19 lockdowns, it looked like a great opportunity to join the market.

### My Current Portfolio
My current main source of income is my full time job working as a Software Developer. I make $72,500 a year before tax.
I have about $26,000 in my TFSA, about $5000 invested in various cryptos in various exchanges. Then I have about $12,000 put away into 
various HSA's. $5100 in an emergency fund, $2200 for general savings I'm looking to get a car or a down payment on real estate. Then I have another savings account with $2428, however realistically this is about $1300
since rent is coming up soon. I have my last account that gets $1000 every month that I use to spend on anything other than bills and groceries that month. This would be for restaurants, clothing, video games, presents etc...
The total I guess comes to about $44,000 in assets. I feel like that is a great start first year into my career. Not to mention I'm stil balancing paying my $1675 a month apartment with my girlfriend and paying off my
$36,000 student loan debt.

My current investing strategy is probably the most laziest out there. Every pay day, I throw in about $500 to my TFSA, which comes out to about $1000 a month, and I have been doing this for nearly two years now.
At first I would choose individual stocks, but I found I just didn't want to be researching stocks all the time to get nearly the same results so I've resorted moving a large portion of my TFSA towards ETF'.
However, I still hold some of my favourite individual stocks. 
1. Apple Inc - Everyone knows apple is a powerhouse, no regrets getting into them
2. RioCan - This is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), essentially a company that owns/operates incoming-generating real estate. This one in particular does
commercial real estate around Canada. During the Covid-19 pandemic this stock dropped to what I considered to be a lower price, and they paid a great dividend at the time which has since been cut (it's still an alright payout atm).
I currently receive about $14/month for holding these shares. Honestly, that's a great payout, and buying monthly that payout will just get bigger and bigger.

Although I have a lot of growth stocks I love getting paid in dividends. There's just something about getting a notification in the middle of the night that you got paid $X amount of dollars for doing absolutely nothing!

### My expenses
I keep an eye on my expenses very closely. I don't think I'm really budgeting, more so keeping track of what I'm spending.
All my spending accounts are tracked by a web service called Mint, it's basically a web app that connects to all your bank accounts, tracks your spending in various categories and let's you set up budgeting categories to monitor your spending
throughput the month. Every month, I come up with a rough idea of what I'm spending that month. Of course there's going to be the essentials first, like the
$1675 rent and parking bill that me and my girlfriend split, then theres the $350 student loan payments I just started paying back (bare minimum payment at about 3.4% interest on $15k of it). Every month the insurance and gas on my 2008 CSX Acura is about 210, it's 
super reliable and I've never had to drain money into fixing it up really. 

I think the important part to my mental health is also budgeting for my miscellanious spending and my I guess 'fun money'. They money I'll use to treat my girlfriend out to dinner, or my parents something like that. I'll budget money out every month
for clothes, video games, hobbies, books, basically anything and everything. Having an idea that your are going to be buying these things in the month get's rid of that dreaded feeling that your spending money when your not supposed to.This works out great for me, because I have the freedom to essentially buy whatever I want, and I am still saving tons for the future that will be compounded.

### What I plan for the future
I think with the trajectory I'm going at I am going to be very well off in the future. Right now, my main focus is my TFSA and RRSP contributions. But I would love to work my way into Real Estate, the Crypto space or the
Software as a Service (Saas) industry for passive income. I'd love to continue exploring differnt ways of generating passive income.

In the next 1.5 - 2 years I want to have MAX'd out my TFSA and RRSP contributions

In the next 5 years I would like to have 1 or more investment properties
