  This is a blog post about my journey of how I got into technology and coding, my experiences and where 
  I'm at today.

<br/>

### The beginning
My early relationship with technology involved playing video games. From creating HTML markup on websites like
Gaia.com or creating a shared VPN network on Hamachi to play Minecraft with my freinds. Technology was always something 
I played around with. In high school I would build my computer, 

Technology was all around me, I never took a deep dive into coding until University.

### My University experience
Three years after highschool, after a brief stint of working as a Barista for a local Calgary Coffee Shop: Good Earth Cafe, I decided to return to school 
to take Computer Science. At the time I thought it was a difficult decision. I would be committing
to a 4 year degree in a completely different city taking out government loans. However, I can confidently say that this decision is probably 
the best choice I have ever made with regards to my personal growth and career. 

### Where I am currently
I am currently working as a Full Stack Software Developer for a Calgary based Software Solutions Company called Arcurve Inc. I have worked with them throughout
my University career as a Student Software Developer. I am extremely grateful for the opportunities they have provided me as it has pushed me to become a great software engineer that
values hard work, working as a team, empowering others, and most importantly creating high quality software.
