### Introduction
By now there’s no question you’ve heard of the buzz words “Bitcoin”, “Crypto” and “Blockchain. 
I’ve heard of these things as well, and I do hold some crypto’s. Over the past month,
 I dove head first into the blockchain development space, and I’m here to tell you what 
 I've learnt in the hopes of giving you a better understanding of blockchain, and what it
  takes to develop something like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and so on!

### What's a 'blockchain'
A blockchain is essentially a technology that is capable of storing blocks of data in a
 sequential fashion. In order to interact with a blockchain and to add more blocks of data, we
  need what is called a ‘smart-contract’. A smart contract is a program that was coded to perform
   some actions on data and record that to the blockchain. However, it’s extremely important to remember 
   that the blockchain is immutable, this means that no one can manipulate the blocks of data stored
    in a blockchain. This is huge for integrity purposes because it gives confidence that the history
     of the blockchain is intact.
