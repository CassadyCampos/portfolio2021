### How to Update Github Access Token for AWS Function

1. On github generate a new access token

- go to settings

- at the bottom go to developer settings

- click that and generate a new token, try and specify minimum requirements you need
- set the date to a date you wish for it to expire

2. Log into AWS 

- go to AWS Lambda function that is using the token

- it's probably in the environment variables so go to Configuration, then in the new tab
  click on 'Environment Variables'

- paste in the new variable and test out the function
